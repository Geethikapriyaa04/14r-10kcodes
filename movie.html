<p> EXHUMA </p>

<pre> Ticket:230/- </pre>

<p> "Exhuma" emerges as a bold tapestry of horror, weaving together an array of tropes that challenge the boundaries of the genre. Its narrative is a complex interplay of classic horror elements, grave digging, psychological twists, demon hunting, and unexpected comedy, creating a cinematic experience that is as unsettling as it is innovative. The overlay of the history of the Japanese occupation adds a layer of moral complexity. While some cultural symbolism may be lost on international audiences, the film's deliberate pacing cultivates a tension that transcends cultural barriers, culminating in a climax that is both disorienting and impactful. "Exhuma" may not prioritize narrative clarity, but it compensates with a visceral journey through the macabre, leaving viewers with a lingering sense of unease and contemplation long after the credits roll. The film's commitment to a slow-burn approach rewards patient viewers with a thought-provoking exploration of horror that refuses to be confined by conventional expectations. </p>
